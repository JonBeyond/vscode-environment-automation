# vscode-environment
A bash file that quickly configs git, vscode, and .bashrc to my liking! This installs the following VSCode extensions, asks you for .gitconfig username and email, and replaces .bashrc and VSCode User Settings and Keybindings. Don't execute until you read through the shell script and understand what everthing does.

Remember to

`chmod u+x configDevEnvironment.sh`

before executing the script in the root directory of this repo with

`./configDevEnvironment.sh`

Happy hacking!
